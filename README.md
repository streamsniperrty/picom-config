# Streamsniperty's Picom Configuration File

This repository holds my configuration file for Picom. I wanted to explain the forks of Picom that I use.

I use ibhagwan's Picom fork for window curvature. In addition, ibhagwan's fork can be used for blurring windows. 
If you want rounded windows and kawase blur, use ibhagwan's Picom.
